# SpatialTranscriptomic_DataExploration
Code to investigate allen brain spatial transcriptomic data provided by the Allen Brain Institute (https://alleninstitute.github.io/abc_atlas_access/descriptions/Zhuang_dataset.html).

Allen Institue code can be found here (https://alleninstitute.github.io/abc_atlas_access/notebooks/zhuang_merfish_tutorial.html), some of which has been copied into the AllenBrainAtlasPlottingFunctions script within this repository.

AOB_MC_data_exploration is the main script to perform data processing and a first-pass of data visualization. To accomplish, I have created custom functions and saved them within the combining_filtering_abc_data.py file.
